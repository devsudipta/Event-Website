This is a fully responsive Event Website Template built using basic HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to help you practice and enhance your front-end development skills. The template includes all essential components needed to create an engaging event website, such as a home page, event schedule, speaker section, contact form, and more.

Features
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across all devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones using Bootstrap's grid system.
Interactive UI: JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, like form validation, toggling content visibility, and smooth scrolling effects.

Event Schedule: Well-structured HTML tables display the event's schedule with options to highlight featured events.
Speaker Section: Includes a speaker section to showcase the event's key presenters, with profile pictures, names, and short bios.
